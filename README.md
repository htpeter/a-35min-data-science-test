# A 35 Minute Data Science Test 

This is a 35 minute long test which reviews an individuals data science skills. Candidates are not 
expected to complete all questions within this time limit to give the reviewer a sense of their 
time management, prioritization, and code quality when under pressure.

## Setting Up The Test 

Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/htpeter/a-35min-data-science-test`.

Using a `python3.6` environment, install the necessary dependencies. These are the usual data science libraries like `pandas`, `numpy` and `sklearn` along with some others.

You can use this command to install these dependencies. 
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`


##### A quick lesson on `-m` for newer Python users
Never seen `-m` before? `-m` is a way to reference modules tied to a specific interpreter. As you may know, you can have many python interpreters installed on your computer. Using `-m` can help you install the dependencies you need for the exact interpreter you want. You can go as far as writing something like `/path/to/my/preferred/python -m pip install pandas`. `-m` functionality exists for many `python` libraries that have Command Line support like `spacy`.
